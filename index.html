               <p>I've always had fun with After Effects and Premiere Pro, so when I offered to make a short teaser video for our college department's fest, I had a very clear idea of what to make. The theme—"A Mad Mad World"—really gave me a lot of creative freedom, and I was able to bring their vision to life while staying consistent with their branding and vibe.</p>
